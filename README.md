# Unblocked Plugin

Unblocked helps you find accurate answers about your application
by augmenting your source code with context from GitHub, Slack,
and [more](https://docs.getunblocked.com/what-is-unblocked).

When a CI job fails on a pull request, Unblocked will post a report
as a comment in your pull request, helping you quickly identify and
resolve the issue.
